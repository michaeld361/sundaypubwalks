🗺️ How to do the walk:

Start at: Kew Gardens Station (District line & London Overground)

1. Step 1: From Kew Gardens Station, exit onto Station Parade and walk straight to Kew Gardens Road; cross at the lights to reach Kew Green.
2. Step 2: Stroll clockwise around Kew Green with St Anne’s Church on your right, then bear left down Ferry Lane to the Thames.
3. Step 3: Turn left along the Thames Path to Kew Bridge; use the pedestrian pavement to cross the river to the north bank.
4. Step 4: On the far side, take the steps beside the pub One Over The Ait down to the riverside and join Strand-on-the-Green heading east, Oliver’s Island on your right.
5. Step 5: Continue under Kew Railway Bridge and follow Thames Path signs through Strand-on-the-Green; at high tide use the signed back-alleys. Keep the river on your right to the Dukes Meadows bandstand (Dan Mason Drive) as your turn-around point, then retrace your steps.
6. Step 6: Walk back west along the towpath; after passing under Kew Railway Bridge, The City Barge will be on your left at 27 Strand On The Green—time for a well-earned pint.

Always check local signs and paths on the day, and take a map app as backup. 🍺
